Intel Security Libraries for Data Center
=========================================


# ***Intel(R) SecL-DC version 4.1.1 GA***

- Base image of Dockerfile is changed from Cent OS to Ubuntu OS.

# ***Intel(R) SecL-DC version 4.0.2 GA***

- Base image of Dockerfile is changed from Cent OS to Ubuntu OS.

# ***Intel(R) SecL-DC version 4.1 GA***

- New attestation reports will now be triggered whenever a Trust Agent starts, including as a result of a host reboot.  Note that this does not affect VMWare hosts.  
	-	As part of this feature, the HVS /reports API now has an additional option for asynchronous report generation - see the Swagger API 
		documentation for details.  Existing calls to /reports will work with no needed changes.
	-	A new long-lived token is required to give the Trust Agent permissions to generate new asynchronous reports on startup.  To support this 
		feature in an environment upgraded from an earlier release, use the 4.1 version of the populate-users script.  Use the new resulting 	
		installation token to run the "tagent setup download-api-token" setup task on each Trust Agent host at the end of the upgrade process.
	-	The new long-lived token expires after one year.  To regenerate the token, generate a new installation bearer token using the 
		populate-users script, and use that token to run the "tagent setup download-api-token" setup task on each Trust Agent host.

- New options for tainting Kubernetes worker nodes have been added to the Intel SecL Kubernetes controller.  These new options are in addition to the previously-supported ability to taint workers on an untrusted attestation.  These new options provide an admission-control capability to help ensure that security-sensitive pods are not scheduled on workers that have not yet proved integrity.
	-	Worker nodes can now be automatically tainted on reboot, clearing the taint based only on a trusted attestation
	-	Worker nodes can now be automatically tainted when attached to the Kubernetes cluster, clearing the taint based only on a trusted
 		attestation.
	-	As with all Kubernetes worker node tainting, pods can be configured with "tolerations" to be scheduled even on tainted workers.  


# ***Intel(R) SecL-DC version 4.0 GA***

- Support for Client Intel (R) PTT (fTPM) has been added. ISecL has always supported the server implementation of PTT.  However, the client implementation has a difference in the endorsement certificate hierarchies that would cause the TPM authenticity verification to fail during Trust Agent provisioning.  This alternative implementation is now supported.

- Support for TPM SHA384 PCR banks has been added. Newer TPMs support SHA384, and ISecL has added support for this algorithm.  The addition of another PCR bank algorithm has also forced changes in the way the HVS will behave when it encounters multiple available PCR banks.  By default, the most secure PCR bank will be preferred when importing flavors or performing attestations.  If a host only has one bank enabled, that bank will be used.  If a host has multiple banks enabled, the HVS will choose the “best” available algorithm and disregard the others.  In most cases this will not be noticeable.  In the specific case where the same flavor will be used on hosts with different PCR banks enabled, however, this may result in “untrusted” results: 
	-	Importing a flavor from a host with SHA256 and SHA384 enabled will generate a flavor using SHA384.
	-	If host is attested that only has a SHA256 bank enabled and does not have SHA384, the host will appear untrusted because no flavors can
 		match the SHA256 hashes available, even if the servers are otherwise identical.
	-	This specific scenario requires separate flavors for the SHA256 systems.  A datacenter may require a RHEL 8.4 SHA384 flavor, and also a 
		RHEL 8.4 SHA256 flavor.  The OS can be identical, but the measurements used at attestation time need to match the measurements in the
		flavors.

- Platform-info gathering fromt eh Trust Agent has been changed to now pull plaform details directly from UEFI and ACPI tables, instead of working through intermediary applications like dmidecode.  
	-	Previous Trust Agent dependencies like dmidecode have been removed
	-	Additional PCR event logs are now available that were previously invisible.  This allows far more visibility and granularity in remote
		attestations and flavor definitions.

- Intel SecL now exposes Flavor templates. Previously the definitions for which PCRs and events would belong in each flavor part were hard-coded.  Given specific host conditions (which security technologies are enabled, etc) and the specific flavor part (PLATFORM, OS, etc), the HVS would use specific PCRs and events.  These definitions were previously not changeable by the end user.  This new feature adds the capability to create new templates that cumulatively apply definitions to flavor parts based on what’s detected on the host.  This allows an adminsitrator to deine which PCRs and events should be used for each flavor part, and to control those definitions based on conditions present on the host.

- The Key Broker now requires that the KMIP client certificate include Subject Alternative Names with the KMIP server's hostname.    
	- 	NOTE: this requirement may mean that older KMIP client certificates will no longer be valid after an upgrade to version 4.0, if
		the previously-generated certificates did not contain the needed SAN.

- Support for the filesystem key manager in the Key Broker Service has been removed.  This feature was provided as a POC-level function to help customers get started using the Key Broker and was not intended for production use.  This functionality has been removed.  The Key Broker now requires a 3rd-party KMIP key manager.

- The Trust Agent and HVS now support communication in NATS mode.  This does not replace the default HTTP communication, but is provided as an alternative.  By default the Trust Agent exposes REST API endpoints through an open port, and communication is initiated by the HVS to make API requests to the Trust Agent.  NATS mode provides an option for an alternative messaging system.  In NATS mode the Trust Agent does not expose any API endpoints.  Instead, the Agent will establish a connection to a NATS server that acts as a messaging system.  The HVS will also route Trust Agent communication via the NATS server, allowing the same functionality provided in HTTP mode.  NATS is a third-party application; additional documentation can be found at https://nats.io.  Sample configuration information for a NATS Server are provided in the Intel SecL Product Guide.

- The Trust Agent has changed how it utilizes TPM ownership.  Previously the Agent would assert TPM ownership at service startup.  This is no longer required.  Instead, TPM ownership is not only required at the time of TPM provisioning, when the AIK is generated and endorsed by the HVS.  This makes the Trust Agent much more easy to use for adminsitrators who also need to use their TPMs for purposes outside of Intel SecL.  The ownership secret is also no longer stored in the config.yml file.
As part of this change, the Trust Agent now supports and defaults to a NULL TPM ownership secret.  If the TPM_OWNERSHIP_SECRET variable is provided in trustagent.env, the installer will use the specified secret.  If no secret is specified, or if the value of the variable is empty, the Agent will use a NULL TPM ownership secret by default.  This change is intended to allow adminsitrators to control and manage the platform TPM and how ownership is used.  Defaulting to a NULL secret also means that the Trust Agent will no longer require clearing the TPM ownership in any but the rarest of cases. 
The Trust Agent will also now support TPM ownership secrets other than the previous 20 byte hex secret.  Any ASCII string can now be utilized.  To force a string to be treated as hex, prefix the secret with "hex:".  Again this allows significantly greater control over the secret for teh platform adminsitrator. 
	- 	NOTE: This change will require upgrades to version 4.0 to re-provision the Trust Agent.  This means that for upgrades to version 4.0, the 
		installation bearer token must be provided.  In addition, if the TPM owner secret is already set, the secret must be provided at 
		provisioning time as well (which will typically be when teh upgrade is executed).  This can also be an opportunity to clear the TPM 
		ownership and use the NULL secret or one of the other new options.

- Dupport for the Docker container runtime interface has been depracated for the container confidentiality feature.  Intel(R) SecL now supports only the CRI-O container runtime itnerface for container confidentiality.



# ***Intel(R) SecL-DC Version 3.6 ***
- The Intel SecL-DC Foundational Security components can now be deployed as containers as well as direct installation
- TPM Endorsement Certificate CAs will now be updated automatically at build time for teh HVS 
- Added Ubuntu support for all Intel SecL-DC components
- Resolved some issues that could appear for very large-scale deployments (100,000 registered hosts)


# ***Intel(R) SecL-DC Version 3.5 ***
- Additional performance and scalability improvements
- Added new filter criteria to the /v2/hosts API.  Hosts can now be searched by trust status, and the response data when retrieving host details can now optionally also include the host-status and Trusted state. See the HVS Swaggerdoc for details.
- Host searches will now return data in a consistent order (based on the timestamp when the host was registered), and can be sorted by ascending or descending order.  See the HVS Swaggerdoc for details.
- The CLI command "setup server" has been replaced by "setup update-service-config" across all Foundational Security services.  See the Product Guide for details.


# ***Intel(R) SecL-DC Version 3.4 ***
- Some environment variables have chaged for clarity/consistency.  These changes are in:
	- populate-users.env
	- trustagent.env
	- wpm.env
  See the Product Guide for details.

- Backend changes have been made to improve the performance of the HVS, particularly for large scale deployments.  


# ***Intel(R) SecL-DC Version 3.3 ***

- The Integration Hub installation variables have been adjusted.  See the Product Guide for details on the updated .env file options.
- Compatibility updates for integration with OpenStack Ussuri

Known Issues
Due to a change in Libvirt behavior, there is a new prerequisite Libvirt configuration change for Workload Confidentiality with Virtual Machines.  
Before installing the Workload Agent, in /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf, ensure that the setting "remember_owner" is set to 0, and then restart the libvirtd service.  If this step is not performed before launching encrypted VMs, on VM restart you will see errors simlar to the following:
"Error starting domain: internal error: child reported (status=125): Requested operation is not valid: Setting different SELinux label on /var/lib/nova/instances/15d7ec2f-27ad-41ed-9632-32a83c3d10ef/disk which is already in use"


# ***Intel(R) SecL-DC Version 3.2 ***

- The Key Broker now supports both Secure Key Caching and Foundational Security workflows with a single codebase.  Previously separate KBS builds were required for each of these use cases, and they have now been merged into a single service.

- Vmware Cluster Registration has been re-enabled in the Host Verification Service.  This function allows registration of an entire vCenter cluster object, which will cause ESXi hosts to automatically be registered or un-registered for attestation in the HVS as they are added to or removed from the vCenter cluster.

- Performance Improvements

Known issues:
- The KBS may not restart automatically when the system it runs on is restarted.  To start the KBS, use "kbs start".  Be sure that the 3rd party KMIP server is available before starting the KBS, if the KBS is configured to use KMIP.

# ***Intel(R) SecL-DC Version 3.1 ***

- Added support for CRI-O and Skopeo to the Container Confidentiality use case.  Previously only the Docker container runtime was supported for this use case.

- The Integration Hub now also pushes information about enabled hardware security features to Kubernetes in addition to the existing Trust and Asset Tag information.


# ***Intel(R) SecL-DC Version 3.0 ***

Updated name - Intel(R) Security Libraries encompasses use cases and enablement solutions for multiple Intel(R) security features.  As new features are covered by Intel(R) SecL, the need has arisen to distinguish use cases based on different classes of security features.  Documents and applications that build on platform integrity attestation solutions related to hardware Root of Trust technologies will be referred to as "Foundational Security" elements.  Other Intel(R) SecL solutions will have their own documentation and applications, including those for SGX.

- Added support for Secure Key Caching based on Intel(R) SGX technology

- The Verification Service has been renamed the Host Verification Service and rewritten in GO
	- The baseurl for all HVS APIs has been updated to replace "mtwilson" with "hvs".  The previous baseurl will remain functional for a time for 	  backward compatibility, but users are advised to update any integrations to use the new "hvs" baseurl.
	- All HVS CLI commands have been changed from "mtwilson" to "hvs"
	- The installation answer file has been renamed from "mtwilson.env" to "hvs.env"
	- Installation variables and configuration elements have changed; please see the Product Guide for details.

- The Integration Hub has been rewritten in GO
	- The instllation answer file has been renamed "ihub.env"
	- Installation variables and configuration elements have changed; please see the Product Guide for details.
	- The Hub no longer uses an API webserver, and no longer requires configuration of "tenants" or assigning hosts to tenants.  Instead, a separate  Hub must be deployed for each integration endpoint (OpenStack, Kubernetes, etc).  See the Product Guide for details.
	- Some CLI commands have changed.  See the Product Guide for details.

- The Intel(R) SecL Custom Resource Definitions for Kubernetes integration have been updated to be entirely container-based.  The installer binary will now configure containers on the Kube Master node to handle the CRD functions.

# ***Intel(R) SecL-DC Version 2.2.1 ***

- Removed IP address salt for TA and VS

Bug Fixes
- Resolved an issue where the TA provisioning would fail with certain TPM modules 


# ***Intel(R) SecL-DC Version 2.2 ***

Bug Fixes
- Resolved an issue where the Key Broker uninstall would fail to remove some files
- Resolved an issue that would cause the Integration hub to fail to retrieve attestation report updates
- Resolved an issue that would occasionally cause containers protected by the Container Confidentiality feature to have multiple failed start attempts before starting successfully
- Updated sample Postgres installation scripts to use an appropriate number of max_connections
- Resolved an issue where Trust Agent hosts could appear untrusted after restarting the Agent


# ***Intel(R) SecL-DC Version 2.1 ***

- Added support for 3rd-party KMIP key managers to the Intel(R) SecL-DC Key Broker
	- The Key Broker still supports a built-in basic key management system for POCs, not intended for use in production
	- The Key Broker will support KMIP version 2.0 compatible 3rd-part key managers. 

- Added support for Trusted Virtual Kubernetes Worker Nodes
	- Adresses the Chain of Trust for Kubernetes Worker Nodes running as Virtual Machines
	- VM Attestation Reports are now created in the Workload Service for all VM starts through libvirt, including VMs 
	  not encrypted by the Workload Confidentiality feature.  Currently the trust status of the VM is effectively the 
	  trust status of the underlying host.

- Database clients fot the Workload Service and the Authentication and Authorization Service will now validate the database server certificate Subject Alternative Names and Common Name.  Corresponding changes to the Verificatios Service are planned for a future release.

- The provided install_pgdb.sh and create_db.sh scripts have been modified to use new env file options (ISECL_PGDB_CERT_DNS, ISECL_PGDB_CERT_IP) to configure the database certificate.  If these env file variables are not set, the database scripts will generate a self-signed certificate using localhost and 127.0.0.1 as the SAN list, meaning the database will be accessible only on the local server.  These variables must be configured with the appropriate IP address/hostname if a remote database will be used.


KNOWN ISSUES
- When using Workload Confidentiality to launch multiple Docker container replicas, containers may go to the CrashLoopBackOff state.  The replicas will still start as expected after a small number of failed attempts, impacting container startup performance.

# ***Intel(R) SecL-DC Version 2.0 ***

- The Trust Agent is now written in GO
	- The Trust Agent installer no longer automatically installs tboot.  Instructions for tboot installation are now included in the Product Guide.
	- The Trust Agent installer no longer automatically installs the Workload Agent.  
	- Trust Agent configuration file and CLI commands have changed with the migration to GO.  See the relevant sections in the Product Guide for 	details.
- All services now support a granular permissions-based model for roles (instead of only predefined roles with hard-coded permissions)
- Added support for RHEL 8.1
- Removed support for RHEL 7
- Resolved an issue where, if a software manifest was deleted from a Trust Agent host, the host could still appear trusted even though the measurements required in the flavor would now be missing.


# ***Intel(R) SecL-DC Version 1.6.1 ***
 - Updated the Workload Agent for Workload Confidentiality using Docker Container Encryption.  An update to the Docker runtime required adjustment to the Secure Docker Daemon used to manage encrypted containers.  


# ***Intel(R) SecL-DC Version 1.6 ***

- Added the Signed Flavor feature
	- Allows the Verification Service to sign Flavors and verify the signature at attestation time to maintain the integrity of the Flavors.
- Added the Workload Confidentiality feature
	- Allows image owners for virtual machines or Docker containers to encrypt the source images of their workloads.  Encryption keys remain under the image owner's control, and are released to specific servers, sealed to that 		server's TPM, upon a successful integrity attestation with attributes that meet policy requirements determined by teh workload image owner.  Because the image decryption key is sealed to the TPM of the host that was attested, 		this means that only a server that meets the requirements of the image owner as proven by an attestation report can successfully access the image.
	- Adds the new Workload Service (WLS)
		- The Workload Service manages mapping image IDs (as they exist in image storage, ie OpenStack Glance) to key IDs
	- Adds the new Workload Agent (WLA)
		- Manages the compute node/worker node operation, intercepting attempted launch of encrypted workloads, makes requests for keys, and manages crypto volumes for accessed images
	- Adds the new Key Broker Service (KBS)
		- Acts as the policy manager for handling key requests.  Verifies that received attestation reprots are signed by a known Verification Service and that the attestation attributes match policy requirements.
	- Adds the new Workload Policy Manager (WPM)
		- Application that encrypts a new workload image
- Authentication for new components (WLS, WLA) now uses token-based authentication provided by the new Authentication and Authorization service (AAS).  This is planned to replace the existing authenticatyion mechanisms for all Intel SecL services in the 1.6 release version.
- Added the new Certificate Management Service (CMS).  This service will replace and centralize all existing certificate management functions in all Intel SecL services for the 1.6 release version.  In the BETA release, this is currently integrated for the AAS and WLS.

# ***Intel(R) SecL-DC Version 1.5***

- Updated algorithms to use SHA384 instead of SHA256
- Updated key generation to use RSA-3K
- Added support for additional Root of Trust options – Intel BootGuard and UEFI SecureBoot – including removing the tboot requirement if UEFI SecureBoot is enabled (due to incompatibility)
- Added integration support for Kubernetes pod scheduling based on Intel® SecL security attributes
- Added the Application Integrity feature
	- Allows the Chain of Trust to extend above the OS kernel using a new measurement agent (tbootXM) built into initrd
	- Supports boot-time measurement and attestation of any static files/folder on the bare-metal Linux file system, allowing adminsitrators to identify application-specific collections of files and folders to attest as part of 		a new SOFTWARE Flavor part
	- Includes a default manifest of Intel® SecL Trust Agent components so that the Agent itself will be included in Platform Integrity attestation
	- Example use cases include creating a SOFTWARE Flavor for QEMU/KVM and Libvirt for virtualization platforms, or for docker.d or other container runtimes for container-based platforms


-----------------------------------------------------------------

- Improved error handling and performance of queue operations (flavor matching, etc)



# ***Intel(R) SecL-DC Version 1.0.1***

Updated Javadoc REST API documentation


# ***Intel(R) SecL-DC Version 1.0.***

New Features: 

- Hardware-rooted Platform Trust Attestation
Intel Security Libraries leverage Intel Trusted Execution Technology and the Trusted Compute Group standards to establish a measured boot environment for servers that use Intel Xeon processors and a Trusted Platform Module.  This measured boot environment allows a server's actual boot state to be compared to known-good values, which enables the detection of malicious code injection, rootkits, unacceptable firmware or software version, etc.  Remote attestation of this comparison through ISecL allows a clear audit report of the boot state of servers in the datacenter to ensure compliance and improve security. 
- Asset Tag Attestation
Intel Security Libraries allow the generation and provisioning of user-defined key/value pairs that can be securely provisioned into the physical TPM of a host and included in the remote attestation process.  This allows datacenter administrators or cloud consumers to gain visibility into tagged attributes, such as the location of the server hardware.
- Support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Microsoft Windows Server, and VMWare vSphere
- Support for TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0
- Unified "Flavor" whitelisting architecture
"Flavors" describe acceptable configuration elements in server firmware and software in a standardized, extensible format.
- Automatic Flavor Matching for easy datacenter lifecycle management
The ISecL Host Verification Service features automatic matching of Flavors to Hosts in the datacenter, allowing for easy yet extremely customizeable management of acceptable datacenter configurations.  
- Parallel delivery of functionality through integration libraries and combined Services
Intel Security Libraries is distributed in two forms:
	- As a set of integration libraries targeted at system integrators, ISVs, and customers who want to develop their own solutions based on ISecL functions
	- As a set of full Service components that offer already-integrated functionality and a ready-to-use REST interface
- Integration Hub provides an easy integration point for scheduler services
Scheduler services (such as in OpenStack) can consume the Trust and Asset Tag attestation information to make scheduling decisions, controlling where workloads are allowed to launch or move based on the attestation status or asset tags of the hosts in the datacenter.
