## Intel® Security Libraries Binary Installation


Intel® SecL services can be deployed as direct binary installations (on bare metal or in VMs), or can be deployed as containers.  This section details the binary-based installation of Intel SecL services; the next major section details container-based deployments.

It is recommended to deploy all control-plane services (CMS, AAS, HVS, WLS) as either containers or binaries, and not a mix of the two.

The Trust Agent/Workload Agent, KBS, and WPM can be installed as binaries or deployed as containers regardless of the installation method used for the control plane.  However, adjustments may be needed to the Kubernetes deployment files provided to allow network access outside of the Intel SecL deployment.














## Installing the Host Verification Service

This section details how to install the Intel® SecL-DC services. For instructions on running these services as containers, see the following section.

### Required For

The Host Verification Service is REQUIRED for all use cases.

* Platform Integrity with Data Sovereignty and Signed Flavors

* Application Integrity

* Workload Confidentiality (both VMs and Containers)

### Prerequisites

The following must be completed before installing the Verification Service:

* The Certificate Management Service must be installed and available

* The Authentication and Authorization Service must be installed and available
* The Verification Service database must be available

### Package Dependencies

The Intel® Security Libraries Verification Service requires the following packages and their dependencies:

- logback
- Postgres* client and server 11.6 (server component optional if an external Postgres database is used)
- unzip
- zip
- openssl
- wget
- net-tools
- python3-policycoreutils

If they are not already installed, the Verification Service installer attempts to install these automatically using the package manager. Automatic installation requires access to package repositories (the RHEL subscription repositories, the EPEL repository, or a suitable mirror), which may require an Internet connection. If the packages are to be installed from the package repository, be sure to update the repository package lists before installation.

### Supported Operating Systems

The Intel® Security Libraries Verification Service supports:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2

* Ubuntu 18.04

### Recommended Hardware

* 4 vCPUs

* RAM: 8 GB

* 100 GB

* One network interface with network access to all managed servers

* (Optional) One network interface for Asset Tag provisioning (only required for “pull” tag provisioning; required to provision Asset Tags to VMware ESXi servers).

### Installation

To install the Verification Service, follow these steps:

* Copy the Verification Service installation binary to the `/root` directory.

* Create the `hvs.env` installation answer file.

   A sample minimal hvs.env file is provided below. For all configuration options and their descriptions, refer to the Intel® SecL Configuration section  on the Verification Service.

   ```shell
   # Authentication URL and service account credentials
   AAS_API_URL=https://isecl-aas:8444/aas/v1

   HVS_DB_USERNAME=<database username>
   HVS_DB_PASSWORD=<database password>
   HVS_DB_SSLCERTSRC=/tmp/dbcert.pem  # Not required if VS_DB_SSLCERT is given
   ```

* Execute the installer binary.

   ```shell
   ./hvs-v4.0.1.bin
   ```

   When the installation completes, the Verification Service is available. The services can be verified by running **hvs status** from the Verification Service command line.

   ```shell
   hvs status
   ```

## Installing the Workload Service

### Required For

The WLS is REQUIRED for the following use cases.

* Workload Confidentiality (both VMs and Containers)

### Prerequisites

The following must be completed before installing the Workload Service:

* The Certificate Management Service must be installed and available

* The Authentication and Authorization Service must be installed and available

* The Verification Service must be installed and available

* The Workload Service database must be available

### Supported Operating Systems

The Intel® Security Libraries Workload Service supports:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2

* Ubuntu 18.04

### Recommended Hardware

### Installation

* Copy the Workload Service installation binary to the `/root` directory.

* Create the `workload-service.env` installation answer file

  ```shell
  WLS_DB_USERNAME=<database username>
  WLS_DB_PASSWORD=<database password>
  WLS_DB_HOSTNAME=<IP or hostname of database server>
  WLS_DB_PORT=<Database port; 5432 by default>
  WLS_DB=<name of the WLS database>
  WLS_DB_SSLCERTSRC=<path to database TLS certificate; the default location is typically /usr/local/pgsql/data/server.crt >
  HVS_URL=https://<Ip address or hostname of the Host verification Service>:8443/hvs/v2/
  WLS_SERVICE_USERNAME=<username for WLS service account>
  WLS_SERVICE_PASSWORD=<password for WLS service account>
  CMS_BASE_URL=https://<IP or hostname to CMS>:8445/cms/v1/
  CMS_TLS_CERT_SHA384=<sha384 of CMS TLS certificate>
  AAS_API_URL=https://<IP or hostname to AAS>:8444/aas/v1/
  SAN_LIST=<comma-separated list of IPs and hostnames for the WLS>
  BEARER_TOKEN=<Installation token from populate-users script>
  ```

* Execute the WLS installer binary:

  ```shell
  ./wls-v4.0.1.bin
  ```



## Installing the Trust Agent for Linux

### Required For

The Trust Agent for Linux is REQUIRED for all use cases.

* Platform Integrity with Data Sovereignty and Signed Flavors

* Application Integrity

* Workload Confidentiality (both VMs and Containers)

### Package Dependencies

The Trust Agent requires the following packages and their dependencies:

* Tboot (Optional, for TXT-based deployments **without** UEFI SecureBoot only)

* openssl

* tar

* redhat-lsb

If they are not already installed, the Trust Agent installer attempts to install these automatically using the package manager. Automatic installation requires access to package repositories (the RHEL subscription repositories, the EPEL repository, or a suitable mirror), which may require an Internet connection. If the packages are to be installed from the package repository, be sure to update the repository package lists before installation.

Tboot will not be installed automatically. Instructions for installing and configuring tboot are documented later in this section.

### Supported Operating Systems

The Intel® Security Libraries Trust Agent for Linux supports:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2

* Ubuntu 18.04

### Prerequisites

The following must be completed before installing the Trust Agent:

* Supported server hardware including an Intel® Xeon® processor with Intel Trusted Execution Technology activated in the system BIOS.

* Trusted Platform Module (version 2.0) installed and activated in the system BIOS, with cleared ownership status OR a known TPM ownership secret.

???+ note
	Starting in Intel SecL-DV 4.0, the Trust Agent will now default to using a null TPM owner secret, and does not require ownership permissions except during the provisioning step.   If ownership has already been taken when the Trust Agent will be provisioned, it will be necessary to either provide the ownership secret or clear the TPM ownership before provisioning.

* System must be booted to a tboot boot option OR use UEFI SecureBoot.

* (Provisioning step only) Intel® SecL Verification Service server installed and active.
* (Required for NATS mode only) A NATS server must be configured and available
* (REQUIRED for servers configured with TXT and tboot only) If the server is installed using an LVM, the LVM name must be identical for all Trust Agent systems. The Grub bootloader line that calls the Linux kernel will contain the LVM name of the root volume, and this line with all arguments is part of what is measured in the TXT/Tboot boot process. This will cause the OS Flavor measurements to differ between two otherwise identical hosts if their LVM names are different. Simply using a uniform name for the LVM during OS installation will resolve this possible discrepancy.
* (Optional, REQUIRED for Virtual Machine Confidentiality only):
  * QEMU/KVM must be installed
  * Libvirt must be installed



### Tboot Installation

Tboot is required to build a complete Chain of Trust for Intel® TXT systems that are not using UEFI Secure Boot. Tboot acts to initiate the Intel® TXT SINIT ACM (Authenticated Code Module), which populates several TPM measurements including measurement of the kernel, grub command line, and initrd. Without either tboot or UEFI Secure Boot, the Chain of Trust will be broken because the OS-related components will be neither measured nor signature-verified prior to execution. Because tboot acts to initiate the Intel® TXT SINIT ACM, tboot is only required for platforms using Intel® TXT, and is not required for platforms using another hardware Root of Trust technology like Intel® Boot Guard.

**Important Note:** SGX Attestation fails when SGX is enabled on a host booted using tboot

**Root Cause:** tboot requires the "noefi" kernel parameter to be passed during boot, in order to not use unmeasured EFI runtime services. As a result, the kernel does not expose EFI variables to user-space. SGX Attestation requires these EFI variables to fetch Platform Manifest data.

**Workaround:**

The EFI variables required by SGX are only needed during the SGX provisioning/registration phase. Once this step is completed successfully, access to the EFI variables is no longer required. This means this issue can be worked around by installing the SGX agent without booting to tboot, then rebooting the system to tboot. SGX attestation will then work as expected while booted to tboot.

1. Enable SGX and TXT in the platform BIOS

2. Perform SGX Factory Reset and boot into the “plain” distribution kernel (without tboot or TCB)

3. Install tboot and ISecL components (SGX Agent, Trust Agent and Workload Agent)

4. The SGX Agent installation fetches the SGX Platform Manifest data and caches it

5. Reboot the system into the tboot kernel mode.

6. Verify that TXT measured launch was successful:

​    txt-stat |grep "TXT measured launch"

7. The SGX and Platform Integrity Attestation use cases should now work as normal.



Intel® SecL-DC requires tboot 1.10.1 or greater. This may be a later version of tboot than is available on public software repositories.  

The most current version of tboot can be found here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/tboot/files/tboot/

Tboot requires configuration of the grub boot loader after installation. To install and configure tboot:

* Install tboot

   ```shell
   yum install tboot
   ```

   If the package manager does not support a late enough version of tboot, it will need to be compiled from source and installed manually.  Instructions can be found here:

   https://sourceforge.net/p/tboot/wiki/Home/

   Note that the step "copy platform SINIT to /boot" should not be required, as datacenter platforms include the SINIT in the system BIOS package.

* Ensure that `multiboot2.mod` and `relocator.mod` are available for grub2

   This step may not be necessary for all OS versions, for instance, this step is NA in case of Tboot installation on Ubuntu 18.04. In order to utilize tboot, grub2 requires these two modules from the grub2-efi-x64-modules package to be located in the correct directory (if they're absent, the host will throw a grub error when it tries to boot using tboot).

   These files must be present in this directory:

   ```
   /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/x86_64-efi/multiboot2.mod
   /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/x86_64-efi/relocator.mod
   ```

   If the files are not present in this directory, they can be moved from their installation location:

   ```shell
   cp /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi/multiboot2.mod /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/x86_64-efi/
   cp /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi/relocator.mod /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/x86_64-efi/
   ```

   Make a backup of your current `grub.cfg` file

   The below examples assume a RedHat OS that has been installed on a platform using UEFI boot mode. The grub path will be slightly different for platforms using a non-RedHat OS.

   ```shell
   cp /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg.bak
   ```

* Generate a new `grub.cfg` with the tboot boot option

    ```shell
    # For RHEL
    grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg

    # For Ubuntu
    grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
    ```

* Update the default boot option

   Ensure that the `GRUB_DEFAULT` value is set to the tboot option.

   a. Update `/etc/default/grub` and set the GRUB_DEFAULT value to `'tboot-1.10.1'`

   ```
   GRUB_DEFAULT='tboot-1.10.1'
   ```

   c. Regenerate `grub.cfg`:

   ```shell
   # For RHEL
   grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg

   # For Ubuntu
   grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
   ```

* Reboot the system

   Because measurement happens at system boot, a reboot is needed to boot to the tboot boot option and populate measurements in the TPM.

* Verify a successful trusted boot with tboot

   Tboot provides the `txt-stat` command to show the tboot log. The first part of the output of this command can be used to verify a successful trusted launch. In the output below, note the “TXT measured launch” and “secrets flag set” at the bottom. Both of these should show "**TRUE**" if the tboot measured launch was successful. If either of these show "**FALSE**" the measured launch has failed. This usually simply indicates that the tboot boot option was not selected during boot.

   If the measured launch was successful, proceed to install the Trust Agent.

### NATS Mode vs HTTP Mode

The Trust Agent can operate in either HTTP mode (default) or NATS mode.  This distinction controls how the Agent communicates with the HVS.  In HTTP mode, the TAgent presents a set of API endpoints for the HVS to access via individual TLS requests.  In NATS mode, the Agent and HVS are connected via a persistent session maintained via a NATS server; in this mode, the Trust Agent will not listen on any HTTP ports.

### Installation

Installation of the Trust Agent is split into two major steps: Installation, which covers the creation of system files and folders, and Provisioning, which involves the creation of keys and secrets and links the Trust Agent to a specific Verification Service. Both operations can be performed at the same time using an installation answer file. Without the answer file, the Trust Agent can be installed and left in an un-provisioned state regardless of whether a Verification Service is up and running, until such time as the datacenter administrator is ready to run the provisioning step and link the Trust Agent to a Verification Service.

To install the Trust Agent for Linux:

* Copy the Trust Agent installation binary to the /root/ directory.

* (Optional; required to perform Provisioning and Installation at the same time.) Create the` trustagent.env` answer file in the `/root` directory (for full configuration options, see section 9.2). The minimum configuration options for installation are provided below.

  For Platform Attestation only, provide the following in `trustagent.env`

   ```shell
  HVS_URL=https://<Verification Service IP or Hostname>:8443/hvs/v2
  PROVISION_ATTESTATION=y
  GRUB_FILE=<path to grub.cfg>
  CURRENT_IP=<Trust Agent IP address>
  CMS_TLS_CERT_SHA384=<CMS TLS digest>
  BEARER_TOKEN=<Installation token from populate-users script>
  AAS_API_URL=https://<AAS IP or Hostname>:8444/aas/v1
  CMS_BASE_URL=https://<CMS IP or Hostname>:8445/cms/v1
  SAN_LIST=<Comma-separated list of IP addresses and hostnames for the TAgent matching the SAN list specified in the populate-users script; may include wildcards>
   ```

  For Workload Confidentiality with VM Encryption, add the following (**in addition to** the basic Platform Attestation sample):

   ```shell
  WLA_SERVICE_USERNAME=<Username for the WLA service user>
  WLA_SERVICE_PASSWORD=<Username for the WLA service user>
  WLS_API_URL=https://<WLS IP address or hostname>:5000/wls/
   ```

  For Workload Confidentiality with Container Encryption, add the following (**in addition to** the basic Platform Attestation sample):

   ```shell
  WLA_SERVICE_USERNAME=<Username for the WLA service user>
  WLA_SERVICE_PASSWORD=<Username for the WLA service user>
  WLS_API_URL=https://<WLS IP address or hostname>:5000/wls/
  REGISTRY_SCHEME_TYPE=https
  ##For the CRI-O container runtime:
  WA_WITH_CONTAINER_SECURITY_CRIO=yes
   ```

  For NATS mode, add the following (in addition to the basic Platform Attestation sample and any other optional features):

  ```
  TA_SERVICE_MODE=outbound
  NATS_SERVERS=<nats-server-ip>:4222
  TA_HOST_ID=<Any unique identifier for the host; this could be the server FQDN, a UUID, or any other unique identifier>
  ```

  Note that the TA_HOST_ID unique identifier will also be the ID used as part of the connection string to reach this Trust Agent host in NATS mode.

* Execute the Trust Agent installer and wait for the installation to complete.

  ```shell
  ./trustagent-v4.0.1.bin
  ```

If the `trustagent.env` answer file was provided with the minimum required options, the Trust Agent will be installed and also Provisioned to the Verification Service specified in the answer file.

If no answer file was provided, the Trust Agent will be installed, but will not be Provisioned. TPM-related functionality will not be available from the Trust Agent until the Provisioning step is completed.

The Trust Agent will add a new grub menu entry for application measurement. This new entry will include tboot if the existing grub contains tboot as the default boot option.

???+ note 
    If the Linux Trust Agent is installed without being Provisioned, the Trust Agent process will not actually run until the Provisioning step has been completed.

* Legacy BIOS systems using tboot ONLY) Update the grub boot loader:

  ```shell
  grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
  ```

* After Provisioning is completed, the Linux Trust Agent must be rebooted so that the default SOFTWARE Flavor manifest can be measured and extended to the TPM. If the Workload Agent will also be installed on the system (see the next section), wait to reboot the server until after the Workload Agent has been installed, as this modifies the default SOFTWARE Flavor manifest.



## Installing the Workload Agent

### Required For

-   Workload Confidentiality (both VMs and Containers)

### Supported Operating Systems

The Intel® Security Libraries Workload Agent supports:

* Red Hat Enterprise

* Linux 8.2

### Prerequisites

The following must be completed before installing the Workload Agent:

-   Intel® SecL Trust Agent installed and active.

-   cryptsetup

-   (REQUIRED for Virtual Machine Confidentiality only):

-   QEMU/KVM must be installed

-   libvirt must be installed


### Installation

* Copy the Workload Agent installation binary to the /root/ directory

* Verify that the `trustagent.env` answer file is present. This file was
  necessary for installing/provisioning the Trust Agent. Note that the
  additional content required for Workload Confidentiality with either
  VM Encryption or Container Encryption must be included in the
  `trustagent.env` file (samples provided in the previous section) for
  use by the Workload Agent.

* Execute the Workload Agent installer binary.

  ```shell
  ./workload-agent-v4.0.1.bin
  ```

* Reboot the server. The Workload Agent populates files that are
  needed for the default `SOFTWARE` Flavor, and a reboot is required for
  those measurements to happen.



## Trust Agent Provisioning

"Provisioning" the Trust Agent involves connecting to a Verification
Service to download the Verification Service PrivacyCA certificate,
create a new Attestation Identity Keypair in the TPM, and verify or
create the TPM Endorsement Certificate and Endorsement Key. The
Verification Service PrivacyCA root certificate is used to sign the EC,
and the EC is used to generate the Attestation Identity Keypair. The AIK
is used by the Verification Service to verify the integrity of quotes
from the host’s TPM.  

Provisioning is the only time that the Trust Agent requires TPM ownership permissions.  If no TPM ownership secret is provided in the trustagent.env file, the Agent will use a null ownership secret to perform the provisioning steps.  If a TPM ownership secret is provided in the trustagent.env answer file, the Agent will attempt to use the specified secret.  If TPM ownership is in a clear state, the Agent will take ownership if a secret is specified.  If the TPM is already "owned," the Agent will try to use the specified secret; if the specified secret does not match the actual ownership password, the provisioning will fail.

Intel recommends using the default "null" ownership secret, as this makes it easy for other applications to also use the Trust Agent, and can prevent the need to clear ownership in the case of a need to re-provision.

Provisioning can be performed separately from installation (meaning you
can install the Trust Agent without Provisioning, and then Provision
later). If the `trustagent.env` answer file is present and has the
required Verification Service information during installation, the Agent
will automatically run the Provisioning steps.

???+ note 
    The `trustagent.env` answer file must contain user credentials for a user with sufficient privileges. The minimum role required for performing provisioning is the "AttestationRegister" role.

???+ note 
    If the Linux Trust Agent is installed without being Provisioned, the Trust Agent process will not actually run until the Provisioning step has been completed.

If the answer file is not present during installation, the Agent can be
provisioned later by adding the `trustagent.env` file and running the
following command:

`tagent setup -f <trustagent.env file
path>`



## Trust Agent Registration

Registration creates a host record with connectivity details and other
host information in the Verification Service database. This host record
will be used by the Verification Service to retrieve TPM attestation
quotes from the Trust Agent to generate an attestation report.

The Trust Agent can register the host with a Verification Service by
running the following command (the trustagent.env
answer file must be present in the current working directory):

`tagent setup create-host`

Hosts can also be registered using a REST API request to the
Verification Service:

```http
POST <https://verification.service.com:8443/hvs/v2/hosts>

{
    "host_name": "<hostname of host to be registered>"
    "connection_string": "intel:https://<hostname or IP address>:1443",
    "flavorgroup_names": [],
    "description": "<description>"
}
```

???+ note 
    When a new host is registered, the Verification Service will automatically attempt to match the host to appropriate Flavors. If appropriate Flavors are not found, the host will still be registered, but will be in an Untrusted state until/unless appropriate Flavors are added to the Verification Service.

![ta-registration](./images/ta_registration.png)

## Importing the HOST\_UNIQUE Flavor

RHEL and VMWare ESXi hosts have measured components that are unique to
each host. This means that a special HOST\_UNIQUE flavor part needs to
be imported for each RHEL and ESXi host, in addition to any other OS or
Platform Flavors.

???+ note 
    Importing a Flavor requires user credentials for a user with sufficient privileges. The minimum role required for creating the HOST\_UNIQUE Flavor part is the “host\_unique\_flavor\_creator” role. This role can only create HOST\_UNIQUE Flavor parts, and cannot create any other Flavors.

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts with the Trust Agent, this can be
performed from the Trust Agent command line (this requires the
trustagent.env answer file to be present in the current working
directory):

```shell
tagent setup create-host-unique-flavor
```

This can also be performed using a REST API (required for VMWare ESXi
hosts):

```http
POST https://verification.service.com:8443/hvs/v2/flavors

{
	"connection_string": "<Connection string>",
	"partial_flavor_types": ["HOST_UNIQUE"]
}
```



## Installing the Intel® SecL Kubernetes Extensions and Integration Hub

Intel® SecL uses Custom Resource Definitions to add the ability to base
orchestration decisions on Intel® SecL security attributes to
Kubernetes. These CRDs allow Kubernetes administrators to configure pods
to require specific security attributes so that the Kubernetes Control Plane
Node will schedule those pods only on Worker Nodes that match the
specified attributes.

Two CRDs are required for integration with Intel® SecL – an extension
for the Control Plane nodes, and a scheduler extension. The extensions are deployed as a Kubernetes
deployment in the `isecl` namespace.

## Deploy Intel® SecL Custom Controller

    #Install skopeo to load container image for controller and scheduler from archive
    dnf install -y skopeo

*  Copy `isecl-k8s-extensions-*.tar.gz` to Kubernetes Control plane machine and extract the contents

    ```shell
    #Copy
    scp /<build_path>/binaries/isecl-k8s-extensions-*.tar.gz <user>@<k8s_controller_machine>:/<path>/

    #Extract
    tar -xvzf /<path>/isecl-k8s-extensions-*.tar.gz
    cd /<path>/isecl-k8s-extensions/
    ```

*  Create `hostattributes.crd.isecl.intel.com` CRD

    ```shell
    #1.14<=k8s_version<=1.16
    kubectl apply -f yamls/crd-1.14.yaml

    #1.16<=k8s_version<=1.18
    kubectl apply -f yamls/crd-1.17.yaml
    ```

* Check whether the CRD is created

   ```shell
   kubectl get crds
   ```

* Load the `isecl-controller` container image

   ```shell
   cd /<path>/isecl-k8s-extensions/
   skopeo copy oci-archive:<isecl-k8s-controller-*.tar> docker://<docker_private_registry_server>:5000/<imageName>:<tagName>
   ```

* Udate image name as above in controller yaml "/opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/yamls/isecl-controller.yaml"
   ``` shell
      containers:
        - name: isecl-controller
          image: <docker_private_registry_server>:5000/<imageName>:<tagName>
   ```

* Deploy `isecl-controller`

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f yamls/isecl-controller.yaml
   ```

* Check whether the isecl-controller is up and running

   ```shell
   kubectl get deploy -n isecl
   ```

* Create clusterRoleBinding for ihub to get access to cluster nodes

   ```shell
   kubectl create clusterrolebinding isecl-clusterrole --clusterrole=system:node --user=system:serviceaccount:isecl:isecl
   ```

* Fetch token required for ihub installation

   ```shell
   kubectl get secrets -n isecl

   #The below token will be used for ihub installation to update 'KUBERNETES_TOKEN' in ihub.env when configured with Kubernetes Tenant
   kubectl describe secret default-token-<name> -n isecl
   ```

* Additional Optional Configurable fields for isecl-controller configuration in `isecl-controller.yaml`

| Field                 | Required   | Type     | Default | Description                                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| LOG_LEVEL             | `Optional` | `string` | INFO    | Determines the log level                                     |
| LOG_MAX_LENGTH        | `Optional` | `int`    | 1500    | Determines the maximum length of characters in a line in log file |
| TAG_PREFIX            | `Optional` | `string` | isecl   | A custom prefix which can be applied to isecl attributes that are pushed from IH. For example, if the tag-prefix is **isecl.** and **trusted** attribute in CRD becomes **isecl.trusted**. |

## Installing the Intel® SecL Integration Hub

???+ note 
    The Integration Hub is only required to integrate Intel® SecL with third-party scheduler services, such as OpenStack Nova or Kubernetes. The Hub is not required for usage models that do not require Intel® SecL security attributes to be pushed to an integration endpoint.

### Required For

The Hub is REQUIRED for the following use cases.

-   Workload Confidentiality (both VMs and Containers)

The Hub is OPTIONAL for the following use cases (used only if
orchestration or other integration support is needed):

- Platform Integrity with Data Sovereignty and Signed Flavors
- Application Integrity

### Deployment Architecture Considerations for the Hub

A separate Hub instance is REQUIRED for each Cloud environment (also referred to as a Hub "tenant").  For example, if a single datacenter will have an OpenStack cluster and also two separate Kubernetes clusters, a total of three Hub instances must be installed, though additional instances of other Intel SecL services are not required (in the same example, only a single Verification Service is required).  Each Hub will manage a single orchestrator environment.  Each Hub instance should be installed on a separate VM or physical server

### Prerequisites

The Intel® Security Libraries Integration Hub can be run as a VM or as a
bare-metal server. The Hub may be installed on the same server (physical
or VM) as the Verification Service.

-   The Verification Service must be installed and available
-   The Authentication and Authorization Service must be installed and
    available
-   The Certificate Management Service must be installed and available
-   (REQUIRED for Kubernetes integration only) The Intel SecL Custom Resource Definitions must be installed and available (see the Integration section for details)

### Package Dependencies

The Intel® SecL Integration Hub requires a number of packages and their
dependencies:

If these are not already installed, the Integration Hub installer
attempts to install these packages automatically using the package
manager. Automatic installation requires access to package repositories
(the RHEL subscription repositories, the EPEL repository, or a suitable
mirror), which may require an Internet connection. If the packages are
to be installed from the package repository, be sure to update your
repository package lists before installation.

### Supported Operating Systems

The Intel Security Libraries Integration Hub supports Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 8.2

### Recommended Hardware

-   1 vCPUs

-   RAM: 2 GB

-   1 GB free space to install the Verification Service services.
    Additional free space is needed for the Integration Hub database and
    logs (database and log space requirements are dependent on the
    number of managed servers).

-   One network interface with network access to the Verification
    Service.

-   One network interface with network access to any integration
    endpoints (for example, OpenStack Nova).

### Installing the Integration Hub

To install the Integration Hub, follow these steps:

* Copy the API Server certificate of the Kubernetes Controller to machine where Integration Hub will be installed to `/root/` directory

???+ note 
    In most  Kubernetes distributions the Kubernetes certificate and key is normally present under `/etc/kubernetes/pki`. However this might differ in case of some specific Kubernetes distributions.

    In ihub.env `KUBERNETES_TOKEN` token can be retrieved from Kubernetes using the following command:

    ```
    kubectl get secrets -n isecl -o jsonpath="{.items[?(@.metadata.annotations['kubernetes\.io/service-account\.name']=='default')].data.token}"|base64 --decode
    ```
    `KUBERNETES_CERT_FILE=/<any_path>/apiserver.crt` in this path can be specified any ex: `/root` which can taken care by IHUB during installation and copied to '/etc/ihub' directory.

*  Create the `ihub.env` installation answer file. See the
    sample file below.


```shell
# Authentication URL and service account credentials
AAS_API_URL=https://isecl-aas:8444/aas/v1
IHUB_SERVICE_USERNAME=<Username for the Hub service user>
IHUB_SERVICE_PASSWORD=<Password for the Hub service user>

# CMS URL and CMS webserivce TLS hash for server verification
CMS_BASE_URL=https://isecl-cms:8445/cms/v1
CMS_TLS_CERT_SHA384=<TLS hash>

# TLS Configuration
TLS_SAN_LIST=127.0.0.1,192.168.1.1,hub.server.com #comma-separated list of IP addresses and hostnames for the Hub to be used in the Subject Alternative Names list in the TLS Certificate

# Verification Service URL
HVS_BASE_URL=https://isecl-hvs:8443/hvs/v2
ATTESTATION_TYPE=HVS

#Integration tenant type.  Currently supported values are "KUBENETES" or "OPENSTACK"
TENANT=<KUBERNETES or OPENSTACK>

# OpenStack Integration Credentials - required for OpenStack integration only
OPENSTACK_AUTH_URL=<OpenStack Keystone URL; typically http://openstack-ip:5000/>
OPENSTACK_PLACEMENT_URL=<OpenStack Nova API URL; typically http://openstack-ip:8778/>
OPENSTACK_USERNAME=<OpenStack username>
OPENSTACK_PASSWORD=<OpenStack password>

# Kubernetes Integration Credentials - required for Kubernetes integration only
KUBERNETES_URL=https://kubernetes:6443/
KUBERNETES_CRD=custom-isecl
KUBERNETES_CERT_FILE=/root/apiserver.crt
KUBERNETES_TOKEN=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6Ik......

# Installation admin bearer token for CSR approval request to CMS - mandatory
BEARER_TOKEN=eyJhbGciOiJSUzM4NCIsImtpZCI6ImE…

```
* Update the token obtained in  Step 8 of `Deploy Intel® SecL Custom Controller` along with other relevant tenant configuration options in `ihub.env`

* Copy the Integration Hub installation binary to the `/root`
    directory & execute the installer binary.

   ```shell
   ./ihub-v4.0.1.bin
   ```

* Copy the `/etc/ihub/ihub_public_key.pem` to Kubernetes Controller machine to `/<path>/secrets/` directory

   ```shell
   #On K8s-Controller machine
   mkdir -p /<path>/secrets

   #On IHUB machine, copy
   scp /etc/ihub/ihub_public_key.pem <user>@<k8s_controller_machine>:/<path>/secrets/hvs_ihub_public_key.pem
   ```



After installation, the Hub must be configured to integrate with a Cloud orchestration platform (for example, OpenStack or Kubernetes).  See the Integration section for details.

## Deploy Intel® SecL Extended Scheduler

* Install `cfssl` and `cfssljson` on Kubernetes Control Plane

   ```shell
   #Install wget
   dnf install wget -y

   #Download cfssl to /usr/local/bin/
   wget -O /usr/local/bin/cfssl http://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssl_linux-amd64
   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cfssl

   #Download cfssljson to /usr/local/bin
   wget -O /usr/local/bin/cfssljson http://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssljson_linux-amd64
   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cfssljson
   ```

* Create TLS key-pair for `isecl-scheduler` service which is signed by Kubernetes `apiserver.crt`

   ```shell
   cd /<path>/isecl-k8s-extensions/
   chmod +x create_k8s_extsched_cert.sh

   #Set K8s_CONTROLLER_IP,HOSTNAME
   export CONTROLLER_IP=<k8s_machine_ip>
   export HOSTNAME=<k8s_machine_hostname>

   #Create TLS key-pair
   ./create_k8s_extsched_cert.sh -n "K8S Extended Scheduler" -s "$CONTROLLER_IP","$HOSTNAME" -c <k8s_ca_authority_cert> -k <k8s_ca_authority_key>
   ```

???+ note 
    In most  Kubernetes distributions the Kubernetes certificate and key is normally present under `/etc/kubernetes/pki`. However this might differ in case of some specific Kubernetes distributions.

* Copy the TLS key-pair generated to `/<path>/secrets/` directory

   ```shell
   cp /<path>/isecl-k8s-extensions/server.key /<path>/secrets/
   cp /<path>/isecl-k8s-extensions/server.crt /<path>/secrets/
   ```

* Load the `isecl-scheduler` container image

   ```shell
   cd /<path>/isecl-k8s-extensions/
   skopeo copy oci-archive:<isecl-k8s-scheduler-*.tar> docker://<docker_private_registry_server>:5000/<imageName>:<tagName>
   ```

* Update image name as above in scheduler yaml "/opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/yamls/isecl-scheduler.yaml"
   ``` shell
      containers:
        - name: isecl-scheduler
          image: <docker_private_registry_server>:5000/<imageName>:<tagName>
   ```

* Create scheduler-secret for isecl-scheduler

   ```shell
   cd /<path>/
   kubectl create secret generic scheduler-certs --namespace isecl --from-file=secrets
   ```

* The `isecl-scheduler.yaml` file includes support for both SGX and Workload Security put together. For only working with Workload Security scenarios , the following line needs to be made empty in the yaml file. The scheduler and controller yaml files are located under `/<path>/isecl-k8s-extensions/yamls`

   ```yaml
   - name: SGX_IHUB_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH
     value: ""
   ```

* Deploy `isecl-scheduler`

   ```shell
   cd /<path>/isecl-k8s-extensions/
   kubectl apply -f yamls/isecl-scheduler.yaml      
   ```

* Check whether the `isecl-scheduler` is up and running

   ```shell
   kubectl get deploy -n isecl
   ```

* Additional optional fields for isecl-scheduler configuration in `isecl-scheduler.yaml`

| Field                    | Required   | Type     | Default | Description                                                  |

#### Configuring kube-scheduler to establish communication with isecl-scheduler

???+ note 
    The below is a sample when using `kubeadm` as the Kubernetes distribution, the scheduler configuration files would be different for any other Kubernetes distributions being used.

*  Add a mount path to the
    `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml` file for the Intel
    SecL scheduler extension:

    ```yaml
    - mountPath: /<path>/isecl-k8s-extensions/
      name: extendedsched
      readOnly: true
    ```

* Add a volume path to the
   `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml` file for the Intel
   SecL scheduler extension:

    ```yaml
    - hostPath:
        path: /<path>/isecl-k8s-extensions/
        type: ""
        name: extendedsched
    ```

* Add `policy-config-file` path in the
   `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml` file under `command` section:

   ```yaml
   - command:
     - kube-scheduler
     - --policy-config-file=/<path>/isecl-k8s-extensions/scheduler-policy.json
     - --bind-address=127.0.0.1
     - --kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf
     - --leader-elect=true
   ```

* Restart kubelet

   ```
   systemctl restart kubelet
   ```

   Logs will be appended to older logs in

    /var/log/isecl-k8s-extensions

* Whenever the CRD's are deleted and restarted for updates, the CRD's
    using the yaml files present under `/opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/yamls/`.
    Kubernetes Version 1.14-1.15 uses `crd-1.14.yaml` and 1.16-1.17 uses
    `crd-1.17.yaml`

    ```shell
    kubectl delete crd hostattributes.crd.isecl.intel.com
    kubectl apply -f /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/yamls/crd-<version>.yaml
    ```

* (Optional) Verify that the Intel ® SecL K8s extensions
    have been started:

    To verify the Intel SecL CRDs have been deployed:

    ```shell
    kubectl get -o json hostattributes.crd.isecl.intel.com
    ```

## Installing the Key Broker Service

### Required For

The KBS is REQUIRED for the following use cases:

-   Workload Confidentiality (both VMs and Containers)

### Prerequisites

The following must be completed before installing the Key Broker:

-   The Verification Service must be installed and available
-   The Authentication and Authorization Service must be installed and
    available
-   The Certificate Management Service must be installed and available
-   (Recommended; Required if a 3rd-party Key Management Server will
    be used) A KMIP 2.0-compliant 3rd-party Key management Server must
    be available.
-   The Key Broker will require the KMIP server’s client
        certificate, client key and root ca certificate.
-   The KMIP server's client certificate must contain a Subject Alternative Name that includes the KMIP server's hostname.
-   The Key Broker uses the gemalto kmip-go client to connect to a KMIP
        server
-   The Key Broker has been validated using the pykmip 0.9.1 KMIP
        server as a 3rd-party Key Management Server. While any general
        KMIP 2.0-compliant Key Management Server should work,
        implementation differences among KMIP providers may prevent
        functionality with specific providers.

### Package Dependencies

###   Supported Operating Systems

The Intel® Security Libraries Key Broker Service supports:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2

   ```

*  Execute the KBS installer.

    ```shell
    ./kbs-4.0.0.bin
    ```

#### Configure the Key Broker to use a KMIP-compliant Key Management Server

The Key Broker must be configured to use a 3rd-party KMIP key manager as part of installation using kbs.env installation variables.


To configure the Key Broker to point to a 3rd-party KMIP-compliant Key Management Server:

1.  Copy the KMIP server’s client certificate, client key and root ca
    certificate to the Key Broker system

2.  Configure the variables in kbs.env for kmip support as below during installation

    ```shell
    KEY_MANAGER=KMIP
    KMIP_SERVER_IP=<IP address of KMIP server>
    KMIP_SERVER_PORT=<Port number of KMIP server>
    KMIP_HOSTNAME=<hostname of the KMIP server.  Must match the hostname used in the Subject Alternative Name fort eh KMIP server client certificate.>

    ## KMIP_VERSION variable can be used to mention KMIP protocol version.
    ## This is an OPTIONAL field, default value is set to '2.0'. KBS supports KMIP version '1.4' and '2.0'.
    KMIP_VERSION=<KMIP protocol version>

    ## KMIP_HOSTNAME can be used to configure TLS config with ServerName.
    ## KMIP server certificate should contain SAN(IP/DNS) or valid COMMON NAME and this value can be provided in KMIP_HOSTNAME. Only FQDN names are allowed.
    ## This is an OPTIONAL field, if KMIP_HOSTNAME is not provided then KMIP_SERVER_IP will be considered as ServerName in TLS configuration.
    KMIP_HOSTNAME=<Hostname of KMIP server>

    ## KMIP supports authentication mechanism to authenticate requestor. This is an OPTIONAL field.
    ## This feature can be added to KBS by updating kbs.env with KMIP_USERNAME and KMIP_PASSWORD.
    ## These are OPTIONAL variables. PyKMIP doesn't supports this feature. This feature is validated in Thales cipher trust manager.
    KMIP_USERNAME=<Username of KMIP server>
    KMIP_PASSWORD=<Password of KMIP server>

    ### Retrieve the following certificates and keys from the KMIP server
    KMIP_CLIENT_KEY_PATH=<path>/client_key.pem
    KMIP_ROOT_CERT_PATH=<path>/root_certificate.pem
    KMIP_CLIENT_CERT_PATH=<path>/client_certificate.pem
    ```


3.  The KBS configuration can be found in `/etc/kbs/config.yml`, KMIP configuration can be updated in this configuration

    ```shell
    kmip:
      version: "2.0"
      server-ip: "127.0.0.1"
      server-port: "5696"
      hostname: "localhost"
      kmip-username: "<kmip-username>"
      kmip-password: "<kmip-password>"
      client-key-path: "<path>/client-key.pem"
      client-cert-path: "<path>/client-certificate.pem"
      root-cert-path: "<path>/root-certificate.pem"
  ```

4.  Restart the Key Broker for the settings to take effect

    ```shell
    kbs stop
    kbs start
    ```

### Importing Verification Service Certificates

After installation, the Key Broker must import the SAML and PrivacyCA
certificates from any Verification Services it will trust. This provides
the Key Broker a way to ensure that only attestations that come from a
“known” Verification Service. The SAML and PrivacyCA certificates needed
can be found on the Verification Service.

#### Importing a SAML certificate

Display the SAML certificate:

```shell
cat /etc/hvs/certs/trustedca/saml-crt.pem
```

Use the SAML certificate output in the following POST call to the Key
Broker:

```
POST https://<Key Broker IP address or hostname>:9443/kbs/v1/saml-certificates
Content-Type: application/x-pem-file
