### Build OCI Container images and K8s Manifests

The build process for OCI containers images and K8s manifests for RHEL 8.2 & Ubuntu 18.04 deployments must be done on RHEL 8.2 machine only

#### Single Node

* Sync the repos

  ```shell
  mkdir -p /root/intel-secl/build/skc-k8s-single-node && cd /root/intel-secl/build/skc-k8s-single-node
  repo init -u https://github.com/intel-secl/build-manifest.git -b refs/tags/v3.6.0 -m manifest/skc.xml
  repo sync
  ```

* Build

  ```shell
  make k8s-aio
  ```

* Built Container images,K8s manifests and deployment scripts

  ```shell
  /root/intel-secl/build/skc-k8s-single-node/k8s/
  ```

#### Multi Node

* Sync the repos

  ```shell
  mkdir -p /root/intel-secl/build/skc-k8s-multi-node && cd /root/intel-secl/build/skc-k8s-multi-node
  repo init -u https://github.com/intel-secl/build-manifest.git -b refs/tags/v3.6.0 -m manifest/skc.xml
  repo sync
  ```

* Build

  ```shell
  make k8s
  ```

* Built Container images,K8s manifests and deployment scripts

  ```shell
  /root/intel-secl/build/skc-k8s-multi-node/k8s/
  ```



## Deployment

### Pre-requisites

* Install `openssl` on K8s master

* Ensure a docker registry is running locally or remotely. 

  > **Note:** For single node `microk8s` deployment, a registry can be brought up by using microk8s add-ons. More details present in Microk8s documentation. This is not mandatory, if a remote registry already exists, the same can be  used as well for single-node
  >
  > **Note:** For multi-node `kubeadm` deployment, a docker registry needs to be setup by the user

* Push all container images to docker registry. Example below

  ```shell
  # Without TLS enabled
  skopeo copy oci-archive:<oci-image-tar-name> docker://<registry-ip/hostname>:<registry-port>/<image-name>:<image-tag> --dest-tls-verify=false
  
  # With TLS enabled
  skopeo copy oci-archive:<oci-image-tar-name> docker://<registry-ip/hostname>:<registry-port>/image-name>:<image-tag>
  ```

  > **Note:**  In case of microk8s deployment, when docker registry is enabled locally, the OCI container images need to be copied to the node where registry is enabled and then the above example command can be run. The same would not be required when registry is remotely installed

* On each worker node with SGX enabled and registered to K8s-master, the following pre-req needs to be done

  * `RHEL 8.2` enabled K8s worker node with SGX:
    * Pre requisite scripts will be available under `k8s/platform-dependencies/` on build machine
    * Copy the platform-dependencies script to SGX enabled worker nodes on K8s
    * Execute  `./agent_untar.sh`  
    * Execute `./agent_container_prereq.sh` for deploying all pre-reqs required for agent
    
  * `Ubuntu 18.04` enabled K8s worker node with SGX:
    * Pre requisite scripts will be available under `k8s/platform-dependencies/` on build machine
    * Copy the platform-dependencies script to SGX enabled worker nodes
    * Execute  `./agent_untar.sh`  
    * Execute `./agent_container_prereq.sh` for deploying all pre-reqs required for agent


* Ensure a backend KMIP-2.0 compliant server like pykmip is up and running.
    * Retrieve KMIP server's key and certificates i.e. client_certificate.pem, client_key.pem and root_certificate.pem files from /etc/pykmip (default path) to master node under `k8s/manifests/kbs/kmip-secrets/` path.
    > **Note:** Under `k8s/manifests/kbs/` , if kmip-secrets folder not available then please create it before copying above key and certs 

* Ensure that system date and time are in sync across all servers (master node, worker node, nfs server, kmip server)

### Deploy

#### Single-Node

##### Pre-requisites 

###### Setup

* `microk8s` being the default supported single node K8s distribution, users would need to install microk8s on a Physical server

* Copy all manifests and OCI container images as required to K8s master

* Ensure docker registry is running locally or remotely

* The K8s cluster admin configure the existing bare metal worker nodes or register fresh bare metal worker nodes with labels. For example, a label like `node.type: SGX-ENABLED` can be used by the cluster admin to distinguish the baremetal worker node and the same label can be used in ISECL Agent pod configuration to schedule on all worker nodes marked with the label. The same label is being used as default in the K8s manifests. This can be edited in `k8s/manifests/sgx_agent/daemonset.yml` , `k8s/manifests/skc_library/deployment.yml`
  ```shell
  #Label node
  kubectl label node <node-name> node.type=SGX-ENABLED
  ```
  
* In case of `microk8s` cluster, the `--allow-privileged=true` flag needs to be added to the `kube-apiserver` under `/var/snap/microk8s/current/args/kube-apiserver` and restart `kube-apiserver` with `systemctl restart snap.microk8s.daemon-apiserver` to allow running of privileged containers 
  like `SGX-AGENT` and `SKC-LIBRARY`
  
* Enable external API communication for `microk8s` to talk to external Intel PCS server

  ```shell
  kubectl get configmap -n kube-system
  kubectl edit configmap -n kube-system coredns
  #edit coredns config map and change the name server as:
  "forward . /etc/resolv.conf"
  #Delete coredns pod, it will relaunch
  ```

###### Manifests

* Update all the K8s manifests with the image names to be pulled from the registry

* The `tolerations` and `node-affinity` in case of isecl-scheduler and isecl-controller needs to be updated in the respective manifests under the `manifests/k8s-extensions-controller`  and `manifests/k8s-extensions-scheduler` directories to `microk8s.io/cluster` based on k8s distributions of `kubeadm` and `microk8s` respectively
##### Deploy steps

The bootstrap script would facilitate the deployment of all SGX components at a usecase level. Sample one given below.

###### Run scripts on K8s master

* The bootstrap scripts are sample scripts to allow for a quick start of SKC services and agents. Users are free to modify the script or directly use the K8s manifests as per their deployment model requirements

```shell
#Pre-reqs.sh
./pre-requisites.sh

#skc-bootstrap-db-services
#Reference
#Usage: ./skc-bootstrap-db-services.sh [-help/up/purge]
#    -help          print help and exit
#    up        Bootstrap Database Services for Authservice, SGX Caching Service and SGX Host verification Service
#    purge     Delete Database Services for Authservice, SGX Caching Service and SGX Host verification Service
./skc-bootstrap-db-services.sh up

#skc-bootstrap
#Reference
#Usage: ./skc-bootstrap.sh [-help/up/down/purge]
#    -help                                     Print help and exit
#    up   [all/<agent>/<service>/<usecase>]    Bootstrap SKC K8s environment for specified agent/service/usecase
#    down [all/<agent>/<service>/<usecase>]    Delete SKC K8s environment for specified agent/service/usecase [will not delete data,config,logs]
#    purge                                     Delete SKC K8s environment with data,config,logs [only supported for single node deployments]

#    Available Options for up/down command:
#        agent      Can be one of sagent,skclib
#        service    Can be one of cms,authservice,scs,shvs,ihub,sqvs,kbs,isecl-controller,isecl-scheduler
#        usecase    Can be one of secure-key-caching,sgx-attestation,sgx-orchestration-k8s,sgx-virtualization,csp,enterprise
./skc-bootstrap.sh up <all/usecase of choice>
```



* Configure kube-scheduler to establish communication with isecl-scheduler.

```shell
vi /var/snap/microk8s/current/args/kube-scheduler

#Add the below line
--policy-config-file=/opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/scheduler-policy.json

#Restart kubelet
systemctl restart snap.microk8s.daemon-kubelet.service
```



#### Multi-Node

##### Pre-requisites

###### Setup

* `kubeadm` being the default supported multi-node K8s distribution, users would need to install a kubeadm master node setup

* Copy all manifests and OCI container images as required to K8s master

* Ensure images are pushed to registry locally or remotely

* The K8s cluster admin configure the existing bare metal worker nodes or register fresh bare metal worker nodes with labels. For example, a label like `node.type: SGX-ENABLED` can be used by the cluster admin to distinguish the baremetal worker node and the same label can be used in ISECL Agent pod configuration to schedule on all worker nodes marked with the label. The same label is being used as default in the K8s manifests. This can be edited in `k8s/manifests/sgx_agent/daemonset.yml` , `k8s/manifests/skc_library/deployment.yml`
  ```shell
  #Label node
  kubectl label node <node-name> node.type=SGX-ENABLED
  ```

* `NFS` storage class is used in kubernetes environment for data persistence and supported in SKC. User needs to setup NFS server and create directory structure along with granting permission for a given user id. From security point of view, its been recommended to create a separate user id and grant the permission for all isecl directories for this user id. Below are some samples for reference

  * Snapshot showing directory structure for which user needs to create on NFS volumes manually or using custom scripts.

  ![NFS Directory Structure SKC Usecase](./images/nfs_skc_directory_structure.JPG)

  * Snapshot showing ownership and permissions for directories for which user needs to manually grant the ownership.

  ![NFS Directory Permissions SKC Usecase](./images/nfs_skc_permissions_dir.JPG)

  * Snapshot for configuring PV and PVC , user need to provide the NFS server IP or hostname and paths for each of the service directories. Sample manifest for creating `config-pv` for cms service

  ```
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolume
  metadata:
    name: cms-config-pv
  spec:
    capacity:
      storage: 128Mi
    volumeMode: Filesystem
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteMany
    persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
    storageClassName: nfs
    nfs:
      path: /<NFS-vol-base-path>/isecl/cms/config
      server: <NFS Server IP/Hostname>
  ```

  Sample manifest for creating config-pvc for cms service

  ```
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
  metadata:
    name: cms-config-pvc
    namespace: isecl
  spec:
    storageClassName: nfs
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteMany
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 128Mi
  ```

  > **Note:** The user id specified in security context in `deployment.yml` for a given service and owner of the service related directories in NFS must be same

###### Manifests

* Update all the K8s manifests with the image names to be pulled from the registry

* The `tolerations` and `node-affinity` in case of isecl-scheduler and isecl-controller needs to be updated in the respective manifests under the `manifests/k8s-extensions-controller`  and `manifests/k8s-extensions-scheduler` directories to `node-role.kubernetes.io/master`
* All NFS PV yaml files needs to be updated with the  `path: /<NFS-vol-path>`  and `server: <NFS Server IP/Hostname>` under each service manifest file for `config`, `logs` , `db-data`

###### Run scripts on K8s master

* The bootstrap scripts are sample scripts to allow for a quick start of SKC services and agents. Users are free to modify the script or directly use the K8s manifests as per their deployment model requirements

```shell
#If using sample script provided for creating nfs directories
#Copy the script to the base path of the NFS location configured
chmod +x create-skc-dirs.nfs.sh
./create-skc-dirs.nfs.sh

#Pre-reqs.sh
./pre-requisites.sh

#skc-bootstrap-db-services
#Reference
#Usage: ./skc-bootstrap-db-services.sh [-help/up/purge]
#    -help          print help and exit
#    up        Bootstrap Database Services for Authservice, SGX Caching Service and SGX Host verification Service
#    purge     Delete Database Services for Authservice, SGX Caching Service and SGX Host verification Service
./skc-bootstrap-db-services.sh up

#skc-bootstrap
#Reference
#Usage: ./skc-bootstrap.sh [-help/up/down/purge]
#    -help                                     Print help and exit
#    up   [all/<agent>/<service>/<usecase>]    Bootstrap SKC K8s environment for specified agent/service/usecase
#    down [all/<agent>/<service>/<usecase>]    Delete SKC K8s environment for specified agent/service/usecase [will not delete data,config,logs]
#    purge                                     Delete SKC K8s environment with data,config,logs [only supported for single node deployments]

#    Available Options for up/down command:
#        agent      Can be one of sagent,skclib
#        service    Can be one of cms,authservice,scs,shvs,ihub,sqvs,kbs,isecl-controller,isecl-scheduler
#        usecase    Can be one of secure-key-caching,sgx-attestation,sgx-orchestration-k8s,sgx-virtualization,csp,enterprise
./skc-bootstrap.sh up <all/usecase of choice>

#NOTE: The isecl-scheduler will not be deployed in case of multi-node K8s as there is dependency on the NFS server IHUB public key to be copied from NFS to k8s master to allow the successful installation of isecl-scheduler. Post update of the isecl-k8s-skc.env for IHUB_PUB_KEY_PATH on K8s master, user needs to run the following
./skc-bootstrap.sh up isecl-scheduler
```

* Create and update `scheduler-policy.json` path

```shell
mkdir -p /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions
cp manifests/k8s-extensions-scheduler/config/scheduler-policy.json /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions
```

* Configure kube-scheduler to establish communication with isecl-scheduler. Add `scheduler-policy.json` under kube-scheduler section, `mountPath` under container section and `hostPath` under volumes section in` /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml` as mentioned below

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - command:
    - kube-scheduler
    - --policy-config-file=/opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/scheduler-policy.json
```

```yaml
containers:
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/
      name: extendedsched
      readOnly: true
```

```yaml
volumes:
  - hostPath:
      path: /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/
      type:
    name: extendedsched
```

> **Note:** Make sure to use proper indentation and don't delete existing `mountPath` and `hostPath` sections in `kube-scheduler.yaml`

* Restart `kubelet` which restart all the k8s services including kube-scheduler

```shell
systemctl restart kubelet
```

## Default Service and Agent Mount Paths

### Single Node Deployments

Single node Deployments use `hostPath` mounting pod(container) files directly on host. Following is the complete list of the files being mounted on host

rm -rf ~/go/pkg/mod/*

#Navigate to specific folder where repos are built, example below
cd /root/isecl/build/skc-k8s-single-node
rm -rf .repo *
#Rebuild as before
repo init ...
repo sync
#To rebuild single node
make k8s-aio
#To rebuild multi node
make k8s
```

### SKC Key Transfer Flow

Below steps to be followed post successful deployment with Single-Node/Multi-Node deployment

#### Generating keys

* From cluster node, copy `k8s/manifests/kbs/rsa_create.py` to KMIP server and execute it using `python3 rsa_create.py`. It will generate the KMIP KEY ID and server.crt. Copy server.crt to cluster node.

* On cluster node, navigate to `k8s/manifests/kbs/` 

* Update `kbs.conf` with `SYSTEM_IP`, `AAS_PORT`, `KBS_PORT`, `CMS_PORT`, `KMIP_KEY_ID` and `SERVER_CERT`
  * `SYSTEM_IP` : k8s Master IP
  * `AAS_PORT` : k8s exposed port for AAS (default 30444)
  * `KBS_PORT` : k8s exposed port for KBS (default 30448)
  * `CMS_PORT` : k8s exposed port for CMS (default 30445)
  * `KMIP_KEY_ID` : KMIP KEY ID obtained by running rsa_create.py on KMIP server.
  * `SERVER_CERT` : Complete path of copied server.crt file obtained by running rsa_create.py on KMIP server.


* Generate the key using `./run.sh reg`

> **Note:** Before generating new key, every time we have to follow above 4 steps. rsa_create.py script will generate new `KMIP_KEY_ID` and `SERVER_CERT` everytime.

#### Setup configurations

* Copy generated key to `k8s/manifests/skc_library/resources`  

* Update `create_roles.conf` under `k8s/manifests/skc_library/resources` for `AAS_IP` to K8s Master& `AAS_PORT` to K8s pod exposed service port (Default:`30444`)

* Execute `skc_library_create_roles.sh` to create skc token

* Update below files available under `k8s/manifests/skc_library/resources` with required values
  * `hosts`
    * Update K8s Master IP and K8s Master Host Name where we generate KBS key
  * `keys.txt`
    * Update KBS Key ID
  * `nginx.conf`
    * Update KBS Key ID in both `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` lines.
  * `sgx_default_qcnl.conf`
    * Update K8s Master IP and SCS K8s Service Port
  * `kms_npm.ini`
    * Update K8s Master IP and KBS K8s Service Port
  * `skc_library.conf`
    * Update `KBS_HOSTNAME`, `KBS_IP` and `KBS_PORT` with K8s Master Hostname, K8s Master IP and  KBS K8s Service Port.
    * Update `CMS_IP` and `CMS_PORT` with K8s Master IP and CMS K8s Service Port.
    * Update `CSP_SCS_IP` and `CSP_SCS_PORT` with K8s Master IP and SCS K8s Service Port.
  
  >  **Note: ** Update skc token in the `skc_library.conf` generated in previous step
  
* Update `mountPath` and `subPath` with generated key id, along with image name in `k8s/manifests/skc_library/deployment.yml`  

* Update `isecl-skc-k8s.env` by uncommenting `KBS_PUBLIC_CERTIFICATE=<key id>.crt` and update the `<key id>` value

#### Initiate Key Transfer Flow

* Deploy the SKC Library using `./skc-bootstrap.sh up skclib`
* It will initiate the key transfer
>  **Note: ** To enable debug log, make `debug=true` in pkcs11-apimodule.ini, kms_npm.ini and sgx_stm.ini files available under `k8s/manifests/skc_library/resources`

* Establish tls session with the nginx using the key transferred inside the enclave
   `wget https://<Master IP>:30443 --no-check-certificate`



### SGX Discovery Flow

* Create below sample pod.yml file for nginx workload and add SGX labels as node affinity to it.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    name: nginx
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
     requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
       nodeSelectorTerms:
       - matchExpressions:
         - key: SGX-Enabled
           operator: In
           values:
           - "true"
         - key: EPC-Memory
           operator: In
           values:
           - "2.0GB"
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

* Launch the pod and validate if pod can be launched on the node. Run following commands:
```
    kubectl apply -f pod.yml
    kubectl get pods
    kubectl describe pod nginx
```

* Pod should be in running state and launched on the host as per values in yml. Validate by running below command on worker node:
```
	docker ps
```



### SKC Virtualization Flow

* Update the `populate-users.env` under `aas/scripts` directory for `SCS_CERT_SAN_LIST` and `SHVS_CERT_SAN_LIST` to add the SGX enabled node IP's
* Deploy all services on SGX Virtualization control plane
* Ensure to update `agent.conf` for deploying SGX agent service
  and run `./deploy_sgx_agent.sh` to deploy `SGX_AGENT` as binary deployment
* Deploy `SKC LIBRARY` on SGX Host, update `skc_library.conf` and execute
   `./deploy_skc_library.sh`
* Follow the [Generating keys](#generating-keys) section to generate the keys

* Copy the generated Key to SGX Host
* Update `keys.txt` and `nginx.conf`

* Initiate key transfer

#### Configuration for Key Transfer On SGX Virtualization Setup

> **Note:** Below mentioned OpenSSL and NGINX configuration updates are provided as patches (nginx.patch and openssl.patch) as part of skc_library deployment script.

##### OpenSSL

Update openssl configuration file `/etc/pki/tls/openssl.cnf` with below changes

```ini
[openssl_def]
engines = engine_section

[engine_section]
pkcs11 = pkcs11_section

[pkcs11_section]
engine_id = pkcs11

dynamic_path =/usr/lib64/engines-1.1/pkcs11.so

MODULE_PATH =/opt/skc/lib/libpkcs11-api.so

init = 0
```

##### Nginx

Update nginx configuration file `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` with below changes

ssl_engine pkcs11;

Update the location of certificate with the loaction where it was copied into the skc_library machine. 

ssl_certificate "add absolute path of crt file";

Update the KeyID with the KeyID received when RSA key was generated in KBS

ssl_certificate_key "engine:pkcs11:pkcs11:token=KMS;id=164b41ae-be61-4c7c-a027-4a2ab1e5e4c4;object=RSAKEY;type=private;pin-value=1234";

##### SKC Configuration

* Create `keys.txt` in /root folder. This provides key preloading functionality in skc_library.

  > **Note:** Any number of keys can be added in keys.txt. Each PKCS11 URL should contain different Key ID which need to be transferred from KBS along with respective object tag for each key id specified

* Sample PKCS11 url is as below

  ```
  pkcs11:token=KMS;id=164b41ae-be61-4c7c-a027-4a2ab1e5e4c4;object=RSAKEY;type=private;pin-value=1234;
  ```

  > **Note:**  Last PKCS11 url entry in `keys.txt` should match with the one in `nginx.conf`

* The keyID should match the keyID of RSA key created in KBS. Other contents should match with `nginx.conf`. File location should match with `preload_keys directive` in `pkcs11-apimodule.ini`

* Sample `/opt/skc/etc/pkcs11-apimodule.ini` file
  	

  ```ini
  [core]
  preload_keys=/root/keys.txt
  keyagent_conf=/opt/skc/etc/key-agent.ini
  mode=SGX
  debug=true
  
  [SW]
  module=/usr/lib64/pkcs11/libsofthsm2.so
  
  [SGX]
  module=/opt/intel/cryptoapitoolkit/lib/libp11sgx.so
  ```

##### Key-transfer flow validation

* On SGX Compute node, Execute below commands for KBS key-transfer:

  ```shell
  pkill nginx
  ```

* Remove any existing pkcs11 token

  ```shell
   rm -rf /opt/intel/cryptoapitoolkit/tokens/*  
  ```

* Initiate Key transfer from KBS

  ```shell
  systemctl restart nginx
  ```

* Changing group ownership and permissions of pkcs11 token

  ```shell
  chown -R root:intel /opt/intel/cryptoapitoolkit/tokens/
  ```

  ```shell
  chmod -R 770 /opt/intel/cryptoapitoolkit/tokens/    
  ```

* Establish a tls session with the nginx using the key transferred inside the enclave

  ```shell
  wget https://localhost:2443 --no-check-certificate
  ```

##### Note on Key Transfer Policy

Key Transfer Policy is used to enforce a set of policies which need to be complied before the secret can be securely provisioned onto a sgx enclave

Sample Key Transfer Policy:
```yaml
"sgx_enclave_issuer_anyof":["cd171c56941c6ce49690b455f691d9c8a04c2e43e0a4d30f752fa5285c7ee57f"],
"sgx_enclave_issuer_product_id_anyof":[0],
"sgx_enclave_measurement_anyof":["7df0b7e815bd4b4af41239038d04a740daccf0beb412a2056c8d900b45b621fd"],
"tls_client_certificate_issuer_cn_anyof":["CMSCA", "CMS TLS Client CA"],
"client_permissions_allof":["nginx","USA"],
"sgx_enforce_tcb_up_to_date":false
```
   a.    `sgx_enclave_issuer_anyof` - Establishes the signing identity provided by an authority who has signed the SGX enclave. In other words the owner of the enclave.

   b.    `sgx_enclave_measurement_anyof` - Represents the cryptographic hash of the enclave log (enclave code, data)

   c.    `sgx_enforce_tcb_up_to_date` - If set to true, Key Broker service will provision the key only of the platform generating the quote conforms to the latest Trusted Computing Base

   d.    `client_permissions_allof `- Special permission embedded into the skc_library client TLS certificate which can enforce additional restrictions on who can get access to the key. In the above example, key is provisioned only to the nginx workload and platform which is tagged with value for ex: USA

##### Extracting SGX Enclave values for Key Transfer Policy

Values that are specific to the enclave such as `sgx_enclave_issuer_anyof`, `sgx_enclave_measurement_anyof` and `sgx_enclave_issuer_product_id_anyof` can be retrieved using `sgx_sign` utility that is available as part of Intel SGX SDK.

* Run `sgx_sign` utility on the signed enclave (This command should be run on the build system).

  ```shell
  /opt/intel/sgxsdk/bin/x64/sgx_sign dump -enclave <path to the signed enclave> -dumpfile info.txt
  ```

* For `sgx_enclave_issuer_anyof`, in info.txt, search for `mrsigner->value` . E.g.. mrsigner->value :
  ```shell
  mrsigner->value: "0x83 0xd7 0x19 0xe7 0x7d 0xea 0xca 0x14 0x70 0xf6 0xba 0xf6 0x2a 0x4d 0x77 0x43 0x03 0xc8 0x99 0xdb 0x69 0x02 0x0f 0x9c 0x70 0xee 0x1d 0xfc 0x08 0xc7 0xce 0x9e"
  ```
  Remove the whitespace and 0x characters from the above string and add it to the policy file. E.g.. :
  ```yaml
  "sgx_enclave_issuer_anyof":["83d719e77deaca1470f6baf62a4d774303c899db69020f9c70ee1dfc08c7ce9e"]
  ```

* For `sgx_enclave_measurement_anyof`, in info.txt, search for `metadata->enclave_css.body.enclave_hash.m` . E.g. metadata->enclave_css.body.enclave_hash.m :
  ```shell
  metadata->enclave_css.body.enclave_hash.m:
  0xad 0x46 0x74 0x9e 0xd4 0x1e 0xba 0xa2 0x32 0x72 0x52 0x04 0x1e 0xe7 0x46 0xd3
  0x79 0x1a 0x9f 0x24 0x31 0x83 0x0f 0xee 0x08 0x83 0xf7 0x99 0x3c 0xaf 0x31 0x6a
  ```
  Remove the whitespace and 0x characters from the above string and add it to the policy file. E.g :
  ```shell
  "sgx_enclave_measurement_anyof":["ad46749ed41ebaa2327252041ee746d3791a9f2431830fee0883f7993caf316a"]
  ```
Please note that the SGX Enclave measurement value will depend on the toolchain used to build and link the SGX enclave. Hence the SGX Enclave measurement value would differ across OS flavours.
For more details please refer https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx/tree/master/linux/reproducibility



### Setup Task Flow

Setup tasks flows have been updated to have K8s native flow to be more agnostic to K8s workflows. Following would be the flow for setup task

- User would create a new `configMap`  object with the environment variables specific to the setup task. The Setup task variables would be documented in the Product Guide
- Users can provide variables for more than one setup task
- Users need to add `SETUP_TASK: "<setup task name>/<comma separated setup task name>"` in the same `configMap`
- Provide a unique name to the new `configMap`
- Provide the same name in the `deployment.yaml` under `configMapRef` section
- Deploy the specific service again with  ` kubectl kustomize . | kubectl  apply -f -`

### Configuration Update Flow

Configuration Update flows have been updated to have K8s native flow to be more agnostic to K8s workflows using `configMap` only. Following would be the flow for configuration update

- User would create a new `configMap`  object using existing one and update the new values. The list of config variables would be documented in the Product Guide
- Users can update variables for more than one
- Users need to add `SETUP_TASK: "update-service-config"` in the same `configMap`
- Provide a unique name to the new `configMap`
- Provide the same name in the `deployment.yaml` under `configMapRef` section
- Deploy the specific service again with  ` kubectl  kustomize . | kubectl  apply -f -`

> **Note:** Incase of agents, setup tasks or configuration updates done through above flows will be applied for all the agents running on different BMs. In order to run setup task or update configuration for individual agents, then user need to perform `kubectl exec -it <pod_name> /bin/bash` into a particular agent pod and run the specific setup task.

### Cleanup workflows

#### Single-node

In order to cleanup and setup fresh again on single node without data, config from previous deployment

```shell
#Purge all data and pods,deploy,cm,secrets
./skc-bootstrap.sh purge <all/usecase of choice>

#Purge all db data,pods,deploy,cm,secrets
./skc-bootstrap-db-services.sh purge

#Comment/Remove the following lines from /var/snap/microk8s/current/args/kube-scheduler
--policy-config-file=/opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/scheduler-policy.json

#Restart kubelet
systemctl restart snap.microk8s.daemon-kubelet.service
